## Landing page

Right now the landing page is the standard devise log in page. The landing page need to give new potientiall users a way to get a feeling of what the site is. Like something the facebook page has as a login page. Easy to login and yet a feeling for the page as weel. 

## Contribute page

We need something that mentions the fact that it is OSS and provide a link to the GitHub repo. This could be a perfect page for students in Lund looking for a simple open source project to contribute to. 

## User assocation to a cooperative

## Cooperative user creation

The cooperative admin should be able to add be able to add users to the cooperative. It should be possible to both add regular users and other cooperative admins
