## Legal issues

The web page is going to be storing person data. This could be against the PUL law in sweden. We need a person with insight to provide knowledge in this.

## Tech/Code

* Making a license footer
* Rename "member" to "worker" in model and controller
* There seem to be two different folders for devise views. The devise folder and the user folder. Both of which are used by devise. This need to be refactored to one folder with all devise logic
* Make sure the webiste is mobile friendly
* Locking the gems version down.

## Minor features

* A website user should be prompted to make a call when clicking a workers phone number on a mobile.
* When editing a worker the activities need to be filled in again. That need to be changed so that the activities aren't lost if the user doesn't fill them in again
* Make landing page responsive (mobile friendly)


## Features

* [Contribute page](#contribute-page)

## Contribute page

We need something that mentions the fact that it is OSS and provide a link to the GitHub repo. This could be a perfect page for students in Lund looking for a simple open source project to contribute to.
